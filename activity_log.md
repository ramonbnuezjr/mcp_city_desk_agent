## 2025-08-28 – RAG Layer Init

- Integrated ChromaDB for PDF ingestion
- Tested with 3 sample agency reports

## 2025-09-05 – CLI Interface

- Built basic command-line client for triggering MCP tasks

## 2025-01-27 16:15 UTC – RAG Layer Implementation

- Implemented complete RAG layer with ChromaDB integration
- Added PDF document processing and semantic search capabilities
- Created dedicated RAG API endpoints for document ingestion and retrieval
- Integrated RAG system with MCP Server command routing
- Established foundation for intelligent document retrieval to improve query accuracy

## 2025-01-27 16:45 UTC – Project Documentation & GitHub Setup

- Updated project documentation to reflect completed RAG implementation
- Marked MVP milestones as complete in project specification
- Established GitHub repository for version control and collaboration
- Set next priorities: Web Dashboard and Report Generation Workflows

## 2025-01-27 18:00 UTC – Rate Limiting System Implementation

- Implemented comprehensive rate limiting system for API protection
- Added per-endpoint tracking with configurable limits (OpenAI: 50/min, Gemini: 50/min, Weather: 60/min)
- Created rate limiting endpoints for monitoring, control, and emergency overrides
- Integrated with main server status endpoint for system health monitoring
- Established production-ready infrastructure for municipal deployment requirements

## 2025-08-12 20:45 UTC – NYC Agency PDF Ingestion & RAG System Validation

- Successfully ingested 8 real NYC agency PDFs into RAG system (100% success rate)
- Fixed ChromaDB metadata type issues (Path objects → strings) and AES PDF decryption
- Upgraded pypdf to 6.0.0 with cryptography backend for encrypted document support
- Created 1,073 document chunks from municipal documents covering housing, health, transportation, and AI governance
- Validated full RAG pipeline with authentic NYC agency data for realistic testing and validation
- Established authentic baseline for 95% API query accuracy KPI validation with real municipal content

## 2025-01-27 21:00 UTC – Streamlit Dashboard Implementation

- Built production-ready KPI-first control room for MCP City Desk Agent operations
- Implemented comprehensive Streamlit dashboard with 5 pages: Overview (KPI tracking), RAG Search (query interface), Collections (document management), Costs & Rate Limits (financial monitoring), and Logs (activity tracking)
- Integrated dashboard with existing MCP-RAG-LLM pipeline for real-time data and live KPI monitoring
- Added secure secrets management with .streamlit/secrets.toml for API key configuration
- Established live monitoring of 95% API query accuracy target, cost tracking, and performance analytics
- Dashboard successfully runs on localhost:8501 with full functionality and real data integration

## 2025-01-27 21:15 UTC – Assistant – Task: Bug Fix and Dashboard Stabilization
Context: Resolved critical error preventing Streamlit dashboard from starting properly
Change: Fixed NameError in logs page exception handling where 'Exception as Path:' was incorrectly typed instead of 'Exception as e:'. This resolved the dashboard startup failure and enabled full access to all 5 dashboard pages.
Assumptions/Risks: Exception handling must use correct variable names for proper error reporting
Verification: Dashboard now starts successfully on localhost:8501 with all pages functional
KPI Link: Dashboard stability ensures continuous monitoring of 95% API query accuracy target and system performance metrics
