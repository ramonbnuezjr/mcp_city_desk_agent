General Requirement:**\n\n*   For projects involving work in City-owned, State-owned, or Health and Hospitals Corporation-owned facilities, a building permit is required. (Document 2)\n*   A building permit is also required for projects exceeding $5,000.00 in non-City/State-owned facilities. (Document 2)\n\n**2. Exceptions:**\n\n*   Projects in non-City/State-owned buildings with costs less than $5,000.00 do not require additional approval. (Document 2)\n\n**3. Approval Process for Projects Requiring Permits (>$5,000 or City/State Owned):**\n\n*   The Facilities and Logistics Construction Manager (CM) assigned to the project will review the scope of work, justification, project schedule, and cost estimate for the renovation or repair work.

Direct Answer:**\n\nThe provided documents do not directly outline the specific health and safety standards for food service establishments in New York City.\n\n**2. Specific Details from the Documents:**\n\n*   **Document 2 (NYC - DOHMH Standards of Conduct 2024.pdf):** This document focuses on the standards of conduct for DOHMH employees, including general conduct, dress, and grooming. It also references sections regarding larceny, bribery, official misconduct, unlawful gratuities, and obstructing governmental administration.\n\n*   **Document 1 & 3 (NYC - TLC Rule Book Chapter 59.pdf):** These documents outline rules and requirements for For-Hire Vehicles, including Livery Vehicles, and related business operations under the jurisdiction of the TLC.

However, the documents offer some insights into related reporting mechanisms and considerations:\n\n**1. Direct Answer:**\n\nThe provided documents do not contain a specific, step-by-step process for reporting a general code violation. However, they do allude to reporting mechanisms for specific situations, such as employee conduct and algorithmic tool usage.\n\n**2. Specific Details from the Documents:**\n\n*   **Employee Conduct:** Document 1 (NYC - DOHMH Standards of Conduct 2024.pdf) outlines standards of conduct for Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) employees. If an employee believes an order is inconsistent with their employment terms, they must comply with the order and then \"may elect to file a complaint through the proper channels.\" This suggests a formal complaint process exists for internal issues.\n*   **Algorithmic Tool Usage:** Document 2 (NYC - OTI Artificial Intelligence Governance Audit.pdf) mentions a planned \"Citywide protocol for receiving, investigating, and addressing any complaints from individuals regarding any suspected or actual harm experienced in connection with an agency\u2019s use of algorithmic tools.\" This indicates a future mechanism for reporting issues related to the use of AI by city agencies.\n*   **Prohibited Conduct:** Document 1 also lists prohibited conduct for DOHMH employees, including making false reports or entries in agency records (Rule 1.4) and submitting false documents (Rule 1.5). This highlights the importance of accurate reporting and the potential consequences of providing false information.\n\n**3. Relevant Procedures or Requirements Mentioned:**\n\n*   **Compliance with Orders:** Employees must comply with orders, even if they believe them to be inconsistent with their employment terms, before filing a complaint (Document 1).\n*   **Accuracy of Reports:** Any reports or records submitted must be accurate and truthful (Document 1).\n*   **Future Protocol for Algorithmic Tool Complaints:** A citywide protocol is planned for receiving and addressing complaints related to the use of algorithmic tools (Document 2).\n\n**4. Source Citations:**\n\n*   NYC - DOHMH Standards of Conduct 2024.pdf (Document 1)\n*   NYC - OTI Artificial Intelligence Governance Audit.pdf (Document 2)\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nWhile these documents do not provide a general process for reporting code violations, they do indicate that reporting mechanisms exist for specific situations, such as employee conduct and, in the future, algorithmic tool usage. Further research into specific agency guidelines and citywide reporting portals would be necessary to determine the appropriate process for reporting a particular code violation.\n"
